.SYNOPSIS
    Signs the locally built widget binaries with a per-user self-signed
    code-signing certificate.

.DESCRIPTION
    Windows 11 Smart App Control can block freshly built, unsigned exes with
    "An Application Control policy has blocked this file". Signing the build
    with a local certificate is enough to let it run on this machine (the
    certificate chain stays untrusted, so Get-AuthenticodeSignature reports
    UnknownError - that is expected).

    The certificate is created in Cert:\CurrentUser\My on first use and reused
    afterwards. No admin rights are required. Nothing is uploaded.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\sign-local.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\sign-local.ps1 -Path build\bin\server.exe

.NOTES
    build.bat rewrites the exes, so re-run this after every build.
